# Analyzing and Forecasting Per Capita Electricity Consumption in Indonesia: A Time Series Approach

## Overview

This repository contains the unpublished paper and the accompanying R Markdown code for the case study titled **"Analyzing and Forecasting Per Capita Electricity Consumption in Indonesia: A Time Series Approach."** The objective of this project is to analyze historical data and forecast future trends in electricity consumption per capita in Indonesia using time series analysis.

Originally, this work was created as part of a university assignment. However, we've decided to share it on GitHub to showcase our skills in data analysis, time series forecasting, and R programming. This project also serves as part of our portfolio for joining the Apple Developer Academy Indonesia.

```

## Methods Used

The project applies the following methods and tools:

- **Data Collection & Preprocessing:** The dataset on electricity consumption per capita is cleaned and prepared within the R environment.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Graphical and statistical analysis is performed to uncover patterns in the data.
- **Time Series Modeling:** Techniques such as ARIMA and Exponential Smoothing are employed to model the time series and predict future electricity consumption.
- **Model Evaluation:** Models are evaluated based on accuracy metrics, and the best-performing model is selected for forecasting.

## Results

The results of this case study include:

- An in-depth analysis of historical electricity consumption trends in Indonesia.
- Insights and recommendations for policymakers based on the forecast results.

For detailed analysis and results, refer to the `CaseStudy.pdf` file.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Veternum/TSA-Forecast-Paper.git
   ```

2. Open the R Markdown file (`CaseStudy.Rmd`) in RStudio or any text editor.

3. Run the code chunks within the R Markdown file to reproduce the analysis and generate the forecasts.

4. To compile the paper, knit the R Markdown file into a PDF or HTML format.
